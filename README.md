# Final_Project

### Presentation pdf file

- ECE 143 Group 5 Project.pdf

### Jupyter notebook file

- final_submission.ipynb

### Third-party modules used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- folium
- statsmodels

### File structure
**folders**
- datasets
  - o3.csv
  - co.csv
  - pm25.csv
  - statewide_cases.csv
- recursive_predictions
  - python files and jupyter notebooks for trend prediction
- single_notebook_file
  - all the individual jupyter notebooks
- total_covid_new_cases_CA
  - calculate the total number of covid cases


**files**
- calculate_total_covid_amount.py
  - combines all the increase covid-19 cases data of each countries in California  
- air_quality_trend.py
  - run plot_aqi_trend(air quality DataFrame, covid DataFrame, AQI column name) to see plot
- quick_COVID_lockdown_timeline.py
  - creates a timeline of COVID lockdown events in California
- final_regression.py
  - filters out for data in california
  - runs filters on that that
  - runs SARIMAX models
  - plots the prediction vs actual
- draw_choropleth.py
  - draws choropleth map from the results of SARIMAX models 
  - demo in draw_choropleth_map.ipynb
- counties.json
  - geometric information of California counties for choropleth maps
### How to run code

- Most of the data is in the "datasets" folder.

- In order to show the california choropleth map, please first trust the notebook (->File->Trust Notebook)

- All the "py" files and plots are combined in "inal_submission.ipynb"

- counties.json (geometric information of California counties for choropleth maps) is place in the root folder

- SARIMAX Predictive model
  - Should be able to run it straight. Do make sure that the folder where the data is to be stored exists
  - eg. in the current code. the folder '/air_quality/CO' folder should exist

### !!! The "draws choropleth map" part in "final_submission.ipynb" might not display correctly in blowser, please download it and use local software to open it. !!!
